/**
 * Created by master on 11.02.19
 *
 * this module replaces the requirejs based management of module and
 * dependency management employing es6 modules in the following way:
 * - all application specific module implementations are explicitly imported here
 * and will be published by this module
 * - all dependencies among application modules are resolved via this module
 * - this way, only Main.js needs to be aware of the actual implementations of
 * of modules, whereas the modules themselves are agnostic with respect to the
 * implementation of their dependencies
 * - in the same way, all dependencies to framework modules are resolved
 * via the framework-modules module, which abstracts away from concrete implementations
 * on its part
 * - additionally, this module will be imported by the main framework implementation
 * (the mwf module), from which the latter obtains all resources that
 * are dynamically instantiated at runtime
